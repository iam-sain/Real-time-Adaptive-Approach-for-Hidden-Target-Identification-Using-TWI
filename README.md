# Real-time-Adaptive-Approach-for-Hidden-Target-Identification-Using-TWI
Through-Wall Imaging (TWI) systems have gained significant attention for their applications
in military, surveillance, and public security. The ability to identify hidden targets behind
walls made of dielectric materials like brick, concrete, and plastic is crucial for situational
awareness. However, image degradation due to clutter and noise is a major challenge in these
systems. This report presents a real-time adaptive approach integrating neural networks and
curve-fitting techniques to enhance target shape identification using MATLAB-based
implementation

**#Problem Statement

Traditional through-wall imaging techniques suffer from image blurring, low signal-to-clutter
ratio (SCR), and difficulty in recognizing target shapes. Conventional image processing
methods are inadequate for handling complex target orientations and environmental
variations. This research aims to develop an intelligent model leveraging artificial neural
networks (ANN) and mathematical curve-fitting techniques to improve target shape
recognition behind walls
